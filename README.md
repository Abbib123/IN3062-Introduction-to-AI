# Pre-warning - We used Google Colab to run our code as in some cases we needed much more RAM than our computers contained
# Steps to follow
1) Install all necessary imports
2) Open coursework.ipynb - we ran this using Google Colab for more RAM availability
3) Uncomment required Model (Each model is contained within 2 fully capitalised comments for what it is using)
4) Run the given code
5) See results
# Additional Notes
1) In the CNN there are multiple models shown, our main model we made and ran was 'Model2', ignore 'Model' as it is outdated, 'MobileNetV2' was a pre-trained model we tested to compare our reuslts against it's results
2) There is also some old code within the CNN section Such as print statements/old variables etc. there are comments along these pieces saying to use them or if they have no impact on the result or were to view during debugging
